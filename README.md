## My Process

I approached this project by creating a responsive and interactive tip calculator using CSS and JavaScript. The application allows users to input their bill amount, number of people, and select a tip percentage to calculate the tip amount and total bill.

### Built With

- **Semantic HTML5 markup:** Structured the content using modern HTML elements for better readability and accessibility.
- **CSS Custom Properties:** Utilized CSS variables for theming and maintaining a consistent design.
- **Flexbox & Grid:** Implemented for layout management and responsive design.
- **Responsive Design:** Employed `clamp()` and viewport-relative units (vw) to ensure fluid layouts across devices.
- **JavaScript:** Managed dynamic data handling, user interactions, and real-time updates.

### What I Learned

This project enhanced my skills in:

- **CSS Variables:** Leveraging custom properties to create a consistent theme and facilitate easy updates.
- **Responsive Design Techniques:** Using modern CSS methods to create adaptable layouts.
- **JavaScript Interactivity:** Handling dynamic calculations, user inputs, and form validation.
- **Error Handling:** Implementing effective feedback mechanisms for user input errors.

### Continued Development

Future improvements and projects will focus on:

- **Advanced JavaScript Features:** Enhancing interactive functionalities and data processing techniques.
- **Improved CSS Styling:** Exploring more advanced CSS animations and effects.
- **Accessibility Enhancements:** Ensuring better accessibility and usability for a wider audience.
